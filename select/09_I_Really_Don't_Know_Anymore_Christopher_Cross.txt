What do you think about love
Is it a game to be played?
To be torn and lost in the wilderness
To be lost and lonely after all

What do you think about love
Is it a way to be saved?
To feel the warmth of another love
Just to be lost and lonely after all

I really don't know anymore
I really can't say
I really don't know anymore
I'm just that way

What do you think about love
Is it a game to be played?
To keep your own heart and have never loved
To be lost and lonely after all

What do you think about love
Is it a way to be saved?
To give up your heart to another love
To be lost and lonely after all

I really don't know anymore
I really can't say
I really don't know anymore
I'm just that way

I really don't know anymore
I really can't say
I really don't know anymore
I'm just that way

I really don't know anymore
I really can't say
I really don't know anymore
I'm just that way

I really don't know anymore
I really can't say
I really don't know anymore
I'm just that way

I really don't know anymore
I really can't say
I really don't know anymore
I'm just that way
