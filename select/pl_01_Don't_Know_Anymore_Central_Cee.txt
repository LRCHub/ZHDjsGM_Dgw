'Cause we're in your drop-top,
and it's hard,
and I'm feelin' you
I calmed down, turned around,
you put me in a mood
Old house, windows down,
but I'm still feelin' you
Years passed, nothing changed,
I'm still in love with you
I don't need nobody else,
I just want you to myself, oh no
Mm
To get to my current position,
I done more than
ten thousand hours
Dreamt that I saw my name
on a gravestone, maybe then
they would give me my flowers
Mum put three of her boys
in the tub same time cah
we couldn't afford to shower
Before man snaked me,
I already saw it comin',
I saw they was sour
But now it's my time
to experience fame,
the opps tryna find out
where am I stayin'
My girl don't believe anything
I'm sayin',
my family need anything,
I'm payin'
Sat down,
tellin' a therapist stories,
I know she ain't gonna relate
What's this? What's that?
I don't care to explain,
I'll deal with the grief
and bearin' the pain
I don't paint these girls
in a positive way,
you can tell that my heart's
been broken before
Tryna heal,
but it's takin' time,
what's the point in life?
I don't know anymore
Tell the young boys,
"Stay in school",
but I wouldn't be here
if I followed the law
I keep makin' dumb decisions
like I don't have
control of my thoughts
The guys wouldn't know that
I'm feelin' like this
'cause I conceal and hide it
Everyone's there
on the weekend vibin',
nobody's there
when I need consignment
I heard the quote that
the strong survive,
but I still got
a fear of us dyin'
Some nights still toss and turn
in my sleep cah I seen
some serious violence
I was six years old
when Dad left home
and they shot my granddad,
all of that at once
My lil' bro's
still going to school,
but he wanna do everything that
the gang does
Now he's repeatin' the cycle cah
he's outside
and he wanna go act up
Got sick of the carton milk,
it was free school meals,
we never had pack lunch
Cuttin' the mould of the loaf
of bread and I looked
in the fridge
and the milk expired
All of the mandem jumped
in the trap cah we put on
The Wire and got inspired
Not surprised
when I see man lyin',
it's fine, I already clocked
they're liars
I just saw a cat that
I know whilst drivin',
I might park up on the block,
say hi
Mum's house bangin' out
Beanie Sigel,
I still don't feel much love
in the air
Lost faith in God
'cause I thought I was cursed,
kept it to myself cah
none of them cared
Tellin' my baby,
"Wait, I don't know
how long it will take,
I'm gonna repair
If it all falls down,
would you bounce? If none of
the tours sold out,
are you gonna be there?"
There's a few times
I lost faith in music,
I put out a tune
and it didn't get views
Me and my broski went and
came up with a plan back then,
but it didn't go through
You know that shit that you say
when you're broke, like,
"When I get dough,
I'ma bring in you too"
Then I blew up and reality hit,
shit,
now I gotta think this through
Three little brothers,
Mum's forty and still ain't
paid off her student loan
My Dad can't move,
he's fuckin' paralysed,
just went through
some serious stroke
The mandem callin' me,
YG's warnin' me,
sayin' that I gotta leave home
I get more money,
more problems now, I had less
to worry 'bout when I was broke
Remember I had one pair of
Air Forces,
tryna keep out the creases
Now the front drive look like
it's a show room,
and none of them leases
I'm extremely grateful
for all my people cah
none of them leeches
I dropped a tape,
got a billion streams and
none of them even features
Now my bredrin dissed me
and tryna go viral
'cause he ain't blown yet,
how is that my fault?
I thought you was Christian,
why don't you move like
Matthew, Phillip, disciple?
But you wan' snake man,
move like Judas
'cause you ain't blew,
it's a fuckin' vio
And we're London,
bare opportunity,
it's not like we live in Ohio
I booked hotels and flights
to all of these shows
and brought you
to all of these countries
Say thank you and pretend
that you're grateful,
but when I turn man's back,
say fuck me
Whole six months livin'
at your mum's,
we was with big bro on our own,
it was us three
Shouldn't ever bite the hand
that feeds you,
I leave man starvin' cah
you're too hungry
I said that I got you,
but you didn't trust me,
I would've, but you didn't
give me the chance
You can ask
any one of the mandem now
if I ever left 'em in the dark
Whatever's meant to be will be,
I can't turn back time or
dwell on the past
But I sometimes wonder,
"Could have I got this far
without losin' my dog?"
Drop-top, and it's hard,
and I'm feelin' you
I calmed down, turned around,
you put me in a mood
Old house, windows down,
but I'm still feelin' you
Years passed, nothing changed,
I'm still in love with you
I don't need nobody else,
I just want you to myself, oh no
